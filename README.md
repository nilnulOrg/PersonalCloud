# Personal Cloud
Personal cloud connects personal devices together. Our aim is to provide a cloud to help users to access their data from **any device, any where**, and do **any operation**, with privacy, persistence, secure and convenience.   
For example, one could access a smartphone album from one laptop computer, or backup albums to a laptop/htpc automatically, or view a video file stored on a laptop from a smartphone or tablet.       

## Comparison with traditional clouds/cloud storage providers.
Traditional clouds like aws/azure, are server side clouds. They are an enhancement to traditional enterprise servers like rack, tape library etc.  Personal cloud is the enhancement to personal computer/laptop/smartphone.  
Personal cloud focus on  
**Convenience:** It must be easy to use, no matter users are IT pros or not.  
**Privacy:** Most people don't want to share their photos with others. Personal cloud is more secure than most cloud storage. No one could view your data in your computer.  
**Free or cheap:** Resources should be free or as cheap as possible.  
**Persistence:** The personal data may be persistent through one's life time.


## Current status
One device could join a personal cloud with/without a shared folder. Folders from all devices in one personal cloud will form a disk/volume. User could access any data in the personal cloud from any device.
